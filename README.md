Simple program to take a text file with folder names on each line and generate the folders.

I wrote this as a solution to a problem faced during a 2012-2013 internship. The company wanted to organize some network storage space and had a mechanism in their CMS software to export a list with all of their customer's account numbers but no way to automate the task of turning that list into a viable directory structure. Further, they wanted a cross platform solution that would work on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. The code was initially rushed to completion to make up for lost time elsewhere in the project. I have intentionally left the code unpolished for the sake of posterity.
